                            This project is a comprehensive API-based system built using Laravel 12. It provides functionalities for user management, project tracking, timesheet logging, and dynamic attribute handling through an Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) model.
                            The system is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing users to manage projects, track work hours, and store dynamic project-related data efficiently. Authentication is handled using Laravel Passport, ensuring secure access to APIs. Additionally, the API documentation is automatically generated using Scramble, providing clear and structured endpoints for easy integration.
